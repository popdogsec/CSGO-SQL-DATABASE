# CSGO SQL Database





This is a database I created for my final project as part of IS443 Database Design, Implementation and Administration. It was created in Microsoft SQL Server.

# Documentation
There are a few documents that provide guidance on how to use the database.
- CSGO Database Business Rules highlights the design requirements that led to its current implementation  
- CSGO Database Data Dictionary shows the table structure and accepted values and constraints
- CSGO Database Documentation explains how to interact with the database and how to utilize the triggers, procedures, functions and views that are built into the database
- ERD Diagram contains a ERD Diagram that highlights table structure and their relationships with each other


# The Database File
In the database file is the commands needed to setup the database as well as a sample dataset from the 2018 Boston Eleague Major. The  sample data is at the bottom of the file and needs to be removed before using it at a tournament. Comments throughout the file should explain what each thing is if it needs to be tweaked.
